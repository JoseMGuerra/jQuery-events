# jQuery events handler

## Events used in this exercise

- The [.ready()](https://api.jquery.com/ready/) method offers a way to run JavaScript code as soon as the page's Document Object Model (DOM) becomes safe to manipulate.
- The [.click()](https://api.jquery.com/click/) method binds an event handler to the “click” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
- The [.hover()](https://api.jquery.com/hover/) method binds one or two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements.
- The [.mouseenter()](https://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/) method binds an event handler to be fired when the mouse enters an element, or trigger that handler on an element.
- The [.mouseleave()](https://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/) method binds an event handler to be fired when the mouse leaves an element, or trigger that handler on an element.
